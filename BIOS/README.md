# LEGAL NOTICE
You assume all responsibilty for using these files and become liable for any damages that may result by doing so. These files are provided AS-IS and are not provided under any warranty implied or express. These files are Copyright &copy; Lenovo. Any attempt to dissasemble, modify, or reverse engineer them may result in legal issues with Lenovo. I am merely providing them, unaltered and in their original state, so that as a last resort, you may recover your bricked laptop using a serial programmer or BIOS flasher. 

## BIOS
Contains BIOS files for the 720s-13ARR. These files were extracted from the fd files found in Lenovos original installers for the BIOS updates. 

## WARNING
These are raw BIOS regions extracted from Lenovos official fd files for the BIOS updates. Flashing any of these files in their current state will give you a working laptop however, they will also overwrite the SLIC table found inside your current BIOS. You will lose all identifying information pertaining to your laptop that is normally embedded in your BIOS including the Serial Number and Windows 10 Pro OEM key.

You must first extract your current BIOS and merge in your SLIC table to preserve the uniqueness of your laptop. Normally, this is done by Insydes flashing software but if you are here, then your computer is already bricked and you cannot use Insydes software. If you are uninterested in manually doing this or lack the abilities to do so, then please be aware of the consequences. The Windows 10 Pro OEM key is non-recoverable. Once it is flashed over, it is gone forever, as it is tied to your motherboard.

I cannot perform this for you, as I lack the skills to do so myself.
